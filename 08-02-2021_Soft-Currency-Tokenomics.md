<h1> Soft Currency Tokenomics </h1>

In the midst of great abundance and rising wealth created by cryptocurrencies, our largest companies and most vocal leaders promote austerity via traditional treasury management. Classes of wealthy investors and corporations, molding crypto to fit their own needs, have limited the protocols in the space. By holding onto claims of code being immutable, the communities and users who actually develop around projects are many times priced out of using their creation and other times not able to even garner funding to maintain critical infrastructure projects. When open-source initiatives go unfunded, audits and good employees are passed on, and developers of massive protocols rely on donations or are forced to seek outside funding, you know that some mechanism is broken.

Several takeaways you should get:

  * Tokens are not code, but rather social consensus based assets. Most tokens currently represent some form of ecosystem-based equity where the agreed upon narrative of the decision makers is the path taken.
  * The supply growth rate (SGR) in tokens is better represented as the flow of tokens coming into or going out of circulation. Whether a team premines or has a mechanism for minting is a meaningless difference.
  * The SGR should be used as a tool. If the benefits of an active influx of tokens outweigh the negative costs on current participants in the ecosystem, it should be undertaken. This could be 1000% SGR or 1%. It is dilutive, but it should be looked at as an investment or subsidy to further some goal seen as more important than the value / distribution of current tokens.
  * In early protocols, token supply growth should be used to bootstrap protocols. In later protocols, the SGR should be used to drive away speculation, subsidizing beneficial behavior to minimize the rent extracted by investors or holders who no longer support the ecosystem.
  * If the SGR needs to move the other direction, taking tokens out of circulation can be done in various ways without large token burns or an active buying policy.
  * Decentralization matters. Having a monetary policy that acts in the best interest of the stated goal of the protocol rather than the team or some group of investors is tough. An active community with expectations of value being pulled from passive investors over time should be a given.

<b>How token valuation actually works</b>

Valuation is subjective, but what this boils down to is that price is a function of in/out of circulation flows of the token. There’s a lot of misinformation in the space about what actually represents the token’s minting policy or rate of supply growth. Usually this is the rate at which the protocol mints tokens, but this is missing a majority of tokens in many systems. It should also include the rate at which a team sells or puts tokens into circulation. For this paper, we assume that the realized SGR is the rate at which tokens are entered into circulation. This means that if the team just doubles its treasury and doesn’t sell them, this actually has no effect on the SGR; but if a team mints themselves 50% of the supply and then dumps it one year from launch, you all of a sudden have 100% inflation in a day.

Following this logic, you have three flows controlling the valuation/price of the token:

  * The users (people buying the token to use in the protocol via staking, txn fees, etc.)
  * The speculators (parties buying solely to sell at a later date)
  * The protocol (inflationary or deflationary pressure from the contract itself)

If the buying pressure of users and speculators is greater than the selling pressure of newly minted coins and from speculators, the value will go up. If selling pressure is greater, the price will go down. It’s common sense, but many teams simply choose a minting policy (e.g. print all the tokens now, constant rate minting, declining rate like BTC), but ignore the long run effects of, or changes that might be necessary to, the monetary policy decisions they made. They like to pretend as if they have no control over the inflation in the system and the price is simply a function of the speculator demand. This mindset leads to unusably volatile coins and that’s exactly what we’ve seen.

Many protocols also have slightly inflexible monetary policies, where it takes a rigid DAO or a hardfork to change the minting rate. That said, many of these projects (or their direct investors) own a lion’s share of the tokens. If a team owns 40% of the supply, they have an insane amount of flexibility when it comes to how/when they put those tokens into circulation and the effect that it can have. Rather than treating those tokens as investments or the team’s only runway for eternity, it’s better to work out an understanding with the community that the treasury is to be managed to help the system. If it runs out or if there is not enough flexibility, then other measures such as adding in a dev share, minting more tokens, or initiating a fork, can be taken.

The incentives are wrong for founders and employees of most token protocols. If you gave every Federal Reserve employee $10M dollars and told them that this is their only salary for the rest of their lives, even if you had the best of intentions as a public servant, self-interest would drive you to hate inflation. For the Fed, the goal should be bolstering the US economy, not maintaining a strong dollar. For a protocol, you have to state your goal, and it shouldn’t be to enrich early holders.

<b>What’s the optimal monetary policy for tokens</b>

Stemming from understanding valuation, you now know that you can mint as much as you want, but you must decide if the negative effects on the price of the token are greater than the benefits gained from the services paid for. If by minting tokens, you can increase users (or long-term value), it is likely a good strategy.

Monetary policy in protocols is very different from fiat or “real world” currencies. For fiat currencies, every time you print money toward one good or service, this means a shift in real resources away from something else. As an example, if you print money to pay for soldiers, you now have less men in the workforce; if you print money to build a road, you may cause construction project costs to go up for everyone else.

With tokens it’s different. Tokens, whether governance or not, are more like equities in that (for most cases) you don’t care about taking resources away from other protocols or investments. If more people develop on or are hired to build your project, unless you’re the biggest protocol out there, you likely won’t shift ecosystem resources in a meaningful way. A government enlisting soldiers can affect real wages in an economy, a protocol minting tokens will likely not have that effect. In addition, taking resources from other projects or ecosystems is sometimes even seen as a good thing where competition is concerned.

Another differentiation is the compulsion aspect. Fiat currencies have the ability to force usage, whereas crypto projects can’t. For this reason, protocols must be more careful in some aspects as users can fork or quickly switch to a different system. If the US government for instance has the value of the dollar lose 10% a year, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the system will collapse (it will be just fine). If on the other hand, a protocol gets a community of speculators hoping for the price to go up by 1000% over the next two years and then minting causes a 10% loss, the cascading effect of sell pressure could quickly turn a 10% loss into an uncontrollable 90% loss.

That said, even a 90% loss in the value of a token, doesn’t necessarily mean that the protocol is dead. As we saw with Ethereum from 2017–2019, a deep drop in the price actually made the protocol more usable. Obviously, there is a limit. When the drop in the price of the token is so great that the SGR needs to increase to unsustainable levels to fund current operations, the price can begin to spiral downward.

<b>Printing in early protocols vs late protocols</b>

One big problem with fixed monetary policies is that there should be different strategies dependent on where a protocol is in its adoption cycle. An early project that launches a governance token with a whitepaper should have a completely different policy than a developed ecosystem whose usage may be hindered by a higher price.

Early projects are 100 percent speculation. There are no users. An “early” project description likely fits the vast majority of projects in the space. As the many different “farming” tokens have realized, minting can be used to bootstrap the project. This is one of the main reasons you should have a token. When coupled with a built in use case for the token (voting, paying fees (e.g. gas), a staking requirement, getting a reward, etc.), parties now have both a way to earn the token and spend it, the start of getting value. In traditional fiat money, the initial value is derived by the need to pay taxes in the currency. Setting a base use case gives your initial currency some value that can actually be measured, but as we’ve seen, the majority of projects get the lion’s share of their value from speculation.

Early protocols are usually completely controlled by the core team. You can have a lot of control over the change in the SGR, but you’re likely to hit a limit in the amount of inflation speculators will be willing to subsidize.

In “late” protocols, you have enough users and a self-sustaining ecosystem. The team may still have tight control of the SGR, but unlike the early days where any action is measured solely by miniscule changes in traction or token price, changes now are heavily analyzed and largely scrutinized. However, these projects still need a monetary policy for several reasons:

  * Continued development of the ecosystem (security, dev share, community outreach)
  * Gradual transfers of ownership to current participants
  * Price stability

The development aspect is huge. At some point, crypto valuations will come back to reality and good projects with poor business models will go under. That said, much of crypto is built on free, open-source software and even during good times, open-source contributors are rarely rewarded. Good tooling for running nodes, custody/ privacy solutions, or even front ends for interacting with the chain are largely centralized and we all know the glaring points of centralization in our ecosystem (Infura, Etherscan, Binance or Coinbase having so much custody, etc.). If a protocol has a more flexible monetary policy, these are tragedies of the commons that can be alleviated with the right funding. Minting in a protocol for bootstrapped security is important, but so are other issues that come up along the way. Having the flexibility to fund these efforts outside of donations is a key piece of moving the space forward.

<b> The case for inflation</b>

Too many speculators can kill a protocol. There are plenty of older articles beating the dead horse that is shaming Bitcoin for losing its purpose as a payment protocol, but the argument still holds. You hear time and time again projects trying to copy the meaningless statement that their coin will act as a “store of value”. Beside the fact that we now have stablecoins, being a store of value with no purpose is not a technical achievement. A shiny rock can be a store of value. The oft purported, immutable “memecoin” is disappointing in that their values start and stop there.

You want to create something. When you invest in something, it should be in something: a community, an education, planting a tree, building a project, raising a child. Protocols too often start with a purpose, but after gaining community members who simply want the number to rise, turn to the old game of acting as collateral in other systems or portfolios rather than furthering the original goal. Inflation should be used to scare away speculators and anyone who utters the phrase “store-of-value”. As time goes on, inflation is a way to slowly pass ownership of the protocol from early investors and builders to current users and investors active in the governance of the protocol.

<b> Does it go the other way? When should you lower the rate/ buy back?</b>

Buy backs, token burning events (not built into the protocol), or any other gimmick is just that. There is a difference between lowering the SGR as the community becomes more stable and fee models begin to work versus the team actively purchasing tokens to support a price.

If you want to take tokens out of circulation, there are a few good ways to do this:

  * Increase protocol burning upon actual use
  * New use cases for the token
  * Increased staking requirement (if in the system)
  * Borrowing of the token

As with fiat currencies, there are a few ways to reduce inflationary pressures in a system (and at the same time keep paying for what you need). Increased taxes are akin to fees that are burnt. This is the EIP1559 in Ethereum where some of the tokens are burnt upon being used for transactions.

The next way to remove tokens in circulation is to drum up new use cases. The petro-dollar scheme is a great example here in the fiat world. By forcing foreign nations to hold US dollars and use them, you allow for your own country to export dollars, thus alleviating your own inflationary pressures. Whether by adding new business lines, increasing transaction fees, or adopting policies to increase usage, there are plenty of projects who do this currently.

As for staking requirements, there may not be a direct correlation in the fiat world, but this is one area that token protocols seem to understand quite well. A move from PoW to PoS is almost always viewed as a positive for the token’s price because more staking will be required, thus reducing the circulating supply. Increases in either the staking requirement or a change that forces or causes more individuals to stake is largely seen as a bullish move. For the sake of this article though, hopefully projects aren’t using an increase in staking requirements to bolster price, but rather for either an underlying security/ incentive reason or to reduce inflationary pressures.

Lastly, borrowing is always an option. In the fiat world, if the government borrows money, this is actually a deflationary act. Assuming we print money to pay for things, there is money in circulation that will either be utilized or taxed. By incentivizing participants to lock up the money in the form of treasuries, you are reducing the circulation now at the expense of increasing it later. This can be a good option for shorter term inflationary pressures and can also provide a lot of flexibility if the issuer of the debt instrument also has flexibility with the SGR of the system (i.e. you can monetize the debt).

<b> What does it mean for decentralization?</b>

It’s hard to have decentralization and the ability to control monetary policy. Protocol owners tend to make selfish decisions and in the long run the tokens become shells for protecting the current distribution of wealth rather than building something of value. This is why founders and early protocols need to start early in getting a community on board with the plan. Expectations mean a lot. Slowly diluting passive holders in favor of active community members should be taken as a given, not a necessary evil.

By building inflationary pressures that reward those contributing, building, and securing, you can create a protocol that evolves and grows towards a stated goal. Flexibility is always tough, but to think the policy launched from a project’s initial deployment will be the last is foolish. Give your policies a chance, but recognize when change must happen, move quickly to change it, and move even faster to abandon it if those in charge seem to lose their way.
