<h1>cheesecake and crypto — minimal decentralization in the story of a resilient (monetary) culture</h1>

I love cooking.

For some reason, I especially get a kick out of cooking dessert. Not because I’m necessarily a sweet tooth or even enjoy baking more than grilling, but I think it’s that I just don’t do it very often, and I guess also it’s just so damn methodical. It’s straight measurements and instructions. And the really glorious part is that once you get the basics down, you get that fantastic joy of it working close to every time. Recipes are the smell good version of stack-exchange answers that you cut and paste and it magically creates working code.

Anyway, I’d been doing this for a while, so to push my cooking to the next level, I decided to challenge myself by finding a little competition. For me, my mother-in-law is sort of the “good cook” around; you know, the “world famous cookies”, “best homemade pie” kind of polish grandma you’d expect kids in some movie to have. So of course, a few years ago I started off hot, right after the prize winner…let’s see who can make a better cheesecake (one of her signatures of course).

Now I knew hers was good, but to be honest, it was kind of homely. Probably on par with a cheesecake factory type of vibe. She’d had the benefit of living in a bubble, and that’s sort of the point.

I googled a bit and found a ricotta one that fit the bill. For those wanting to try searching on their own, you want 5 stars, detailed instructions, and a decent number of reviews. So fast-forward a bit, and not to belabor the story, on the night contest, it was declared a tie. Hers was the “classic” taste and mine was just “amazing, but not a cream-cheese base which was expected”, (so how could you ever compare).

I knew they we’re protecting her ego from the fact that seconds taken we’re all mine. This was a fine victory for my baking skills.

So I started doing it every holiday, against different hand me down recipes and “traditional” favorites. And shocker, every holiday I would get the same results or better. This was the bubble effect. For so long, each family or societal group had its own little bubble. Recipes were shared via word of mouth and oftentimes it was pretty uncontested (how many cheesecake recipes we’re floating around small towns in the 60’s). The bubble actually preserved culture.

But now you get ratings. Comparisons and reviews that touch the tastebuds of thousands of home cooks each year, with tips and a comment section style open-source development of the “best” recipe.

It’s hard to beat. The best out there for the most people.

And this is great. Rather than recipes coming from the “centralized” authority being the person in your social circle with the instructions, the openness to all, the say “decentralization” of the recipes leads to everyone getting to enjoy a little bit better of a cheesecake. For those economists out there…more utility and less inefficiency, right?

But let’s analyze that. What’s the game theoretic equilibrium? Where do we end up? You know the answer; it’s obvious if you think about it; and we all converge. We have a handful of battle tested recipes that stand up to the test of time and work as the “best”.

Global access of recipe information has led to a homogeneity. You could say that you have more “decentralization” because you can pick from any recipe, but actually the flavors of the past, the hand me downs, are lost. The “centralized” aspect of each bubble was actually better for the system as a whole.

And this isn’t just recipes. You can see the internet as the “decentralizing of information”. Rather than have just one local paper, your shitty local news, or even one library, you now get it all! No more relying on that pesky post-office to send letters, the government sponsored academics for research, or even your grandma for a recipe. Every piece of information on the globe (and the transfer of it) is now at your fingertips and it’s amazing.

But still we all know it’s not the dream. It’s been captured in our race for simplicity and an easy user-experience.

Google controls search, Facebook social, and a handful of companies in between. Others have written this topic to death so I won’t, however you can see that just opening something up, globalizing it, or taking the local “state” control out of it, doesn’t really serve us. Rather than open the whole world up to new ideas, new opinions or systems, we all decided that it was an excellent time to standardize the truth in the free market for ideas.

In terms of what we’re talking about here for decentralization is that these “global systems”, the internet, the AI, the all-encompassing cloud or database, the global news network; each one further removes nuance. We can’t possibly consume it all, so the winning team simplifies it. It gives a “right answer” that’s easy to find. That recipe search in chatGPT doesn’t give you hundreds of results with reviews, it gives you one. A winner take all system that drives us toward a “truth”.

Ok, but how the hell does this have anything to do with crypto?

We have to keep our eyes on the goal and purposefully examine whether advances in technology are serving their purpose.

In the way that the internet “decentralized” the transfer of information, crypto enables the decentralized transfer of value (well at least digital value). For all the mistakes the internet made in its capture, crypto has the benefit of coming second. We can learn.

All else equal, decentralization leads to robustness and antifragility, but decentralization of something matters at all levels of the stack. You can “decentralize” something in one area and it actually leads to problems and monopolies in other areas.

I got into crypto because I wanted non-sovereign currencies. Money not controlled by the state. I saw how money leads to inequality and unnecessary competition, and even more so it leads to war. I wanted to create a currency that didn’t cripple the actual people it was made to serve. But I’ve realized you can’t create “a” currency. You need to create an unlimited amount of them.

Why did Satoshi want to create a “peer-to-peer digital cash”? It wasn’t because he wanted to get rich or even compete with the dollar. It was because he wanted an alternative. The point of decentralization has always been regulatory arbitrage. Even from the beginning. I’d bet that if creating a competing currency we’re legal he would have done that. But existing monopolies use force and regulation to enshrine their position.

This is why decentralization.

First it was supposed to be money, but the silk road incidents and the ensuing kyc/aml push that forced exchanges to dox their customers killed it. With no way on or off in a private manner, the state still controlled it. Luckily not all was lost. ICO’s took off. The regulatory arbitrage here was capital formation and VC’s (at least in the US it was a game for the rich and well-connected and everyone knew it). Granted there have been issues, but it’s easier than ever to make value out of thin air. You create a protocol/company/thing and the token is sort of security like, but so much more flexible and open that it beats that expensive IPO process a million to one. Moving along, we’ve just been making ways to trade that value we’ve created, be it in a private manner (zk proofs), cheaply (scaling solutions), or converting the risk to something else (e.g. a yield in defi). But it’s all just because you can’t do it legally.

If you really want to kill crypto, legalize it all and say you can do an ICO on a centralized server. Start a CBDC that’s a private bearer asset on a programmable chain. That’s a fatal blow. We’d be as irrelevant as your local sports bookie in 2023.

A giant decentralized system isn’t the goal, however. Similar to any centralized system, economies of scale exist for crypto-economically incentivized actors as well. You see it with Bitcoin (miners tend to centralize around a few), PoS networks (exchanges and large pools dominate), and everything in between. So unless you’re crazy dogmatic about your fervor for a specific coin, it’s easy imagine if btc we’re mined mainly by nation states and/or all staking on Ethereum was done via deposits at the Fed Staking Window. It’s going to happen if we’re “successful”.

Bitcoin (or any other crypto) as the world currency is in the long run as undesirable as the global WEF run CBDC we all rally against. We all know the problems of “one world government” and we push crypto as an alternative, but then for some reason fall short of actually finding an end solution. Bitcoin itself is a solution not because it’s better than fiat, but because it’s different. The fact that it’s a minority system is in and of itself part of the answer. Market systems monopolize in the long run and it’s the job of a vigilant population to combat this force.

And let’s be clear too, should a single crypto win, it would be worse in many ways than the centralized alternative. The system would be captured, but as crypto entrepreneurs had no liability in the earlier stage, the monopolists of the systems future have little liability in late stages. Don’t like the distribution of your new currency? Tough shit, its decentralized. Do you disagree with the wars waged via the inflation in a system? Hard time opting out. Is the entire mempool censoring transactions from North Korea and Iran? Can’t really change it with a law.

You see this “decentralization” (or previously called “privatization”, sometimes called “democratization”) constantly in the market. The government will make the Fed “independent”. A king will become a “democratically elected” president. Or on a micro level, a government service will be bid off to save money and allow the free market to work. This is how you end up with private prisons, national parks owned by billionaires that charge access fees, and private military defense contractors engaged in shadow wars. Decentralization that leads to centralization w/ less liability is the worst of both worlds.

So why do it? Why push for crypto? Where’s the optimist hang out in the conversation?

As I said, decentralization is good for those nefarious use cases precisely because it limits and distributes liability. But the goal isn’t decentralization for decentralization’s sake; it’s a limit to power. For those that know the scalability trilemma[1], you should know that the only reason to put something on distributed ledger is if you really, really, really don’t want someone to be able to shut it down. Like access to your own money, information you don’t ever want to get deleted, etc.

You don’t actually want decentralization; you want freedom and autonomy, and this is where we’re headed. I know we’re fighting the globalists more than ever before, but the high tech, equitable, high community, high leisure futurist option is more within our reach than ever and folks in the crypto space are at the bleeding edge of imagining and building it.

Think about what we want and then think about what we’re building. You want an opt-in system. You want the ability to organize as a small (or larger) group of people, do what you want and leave when you want. You want the ability to innovate or the freedom to stay conservative. Crytpo is just a means to this end; a money or value subset for each goal.

Piracy in music forced the industry to innovate and make music cheaper because people had options. In this sense, the goal of crypto is a backstop. We can use it if inflation gets out of hand. We can use it to avoid sanctions. The idea is that if we don’t want to use a current set of financial regulations or legal framework, we’ll make our own.

The fact that you can create a pseudo-currency that encompasses aspects of traditional equity and the flexibility of a programmable financial asset….this idea isn’t going away. It’s won and it’s just a matter of time before every country scraps its current financial stack and uses something like it. New forms of value are here. Private stablecoins pegged to any basket you want, transferrable to any chain (or country) cheaply…we’re just about there. This means you’ll never have to sit in a currency that’s hyperinflating. You’ll never have to trust another institution to custody your funds. You don’t have to support systems that sanction entire countries or fund unjust wars. This is huge and the freedom it will create for people at home and abroad is enormous and 100% worth your time.

But sitting in the shadows isn’t the goal, and the tools built for the shadows aren’t the optimal design.

As any of you know who’ve had bank accounts cancelled, been cancelled on social media, or been on the wrong side of an opinion; being legal is nice. We like systems that fit our values and most of us would rather stay in a system with sensible regulations and custody. It works way better and is much simpler. But you need the backstop. The only thing preventing the regime from getting out of hand is the option. The cryptocurrency.

And this is how we loop back to me beating old ladies at cooking competitions. The progress from centralization to decentralization may not be what it seems. As a social collective (or whatever you want to call it), convenience can’t be the driver. Guiding principles; ideas of privacy, autonomy, and individual freedom and property rights…these can assist, but even those definitions change. You have to think hard about what to decentralize and what it will lead to, and you have to reevaluate every step of the way. Maybe not every piece of information needs to be online. Maybe you don’t need access to every recipe, ranked and organized. Maybe homogeneity in financial instruments is something to be fought against.

As a start, we have to generate backups. We have to proactively create and support the minority clients. More nuance in search results and products IS bad ux. And that’s fine because it’s an admission that not everything will work for everyone. In crypto we need robustness. We need to actively seek the systems with bad UX that add something different.

You are going to have to be conscious about this. You’re going to have to think about what to build and whether you should. You might need to stop pushing for institutional adoption. Maybe push for minimum viable adoption. What’s the society you strive for? Find like-minded people and push for the same. Truly winning looks like eternally struggling for market share; so let’s keep it up.
