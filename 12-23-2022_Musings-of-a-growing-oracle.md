<h1>Musings of a Growing Oracle</h1>

Over the six years I’ve been full-time in crypto, we’ve gone through quite a bit of change, so I figured I’d just reflect a bit and lay out some thoughts on the space, oracles and how I see this niche little area we call home progressing over the next few years.

<b>To summarize for those of you not wanting to read a long article:</b>

  * Non-speculation/ trading users are still few and far between
  * Valuations though are huge and largely unsubstantiated
  * We’re in a multi-chain, multi-multi-chain framework world and will be for a long time
  * Bridges will be run by L1 validators
  * Oracles will be actually decentralized
  * Oracles will turn into public goods with a focus on reporting unique data sources, less focus on dispute resolution/truth, will be handled by individual projects

<b>itty bitty user committee</b>

If you’re reading this, you’re likely pretty deep in the thick of it. But let’s be honest with ourselves for a few seconds, most people don’t realize how small our crypto industry is. Not the CNBC “crypto” industry, but actual on-chain transactions with a wallet thing. And by small I’m not talking small country size or even medium sized city. If you look at actual defi or people using these things for something other than straight up token speculation or arbitrage, the user numbers aren’t ground breaking. I’d honestly put money on the number of people directly employed by the space being comparable to the number of actual non-speculator users.

But don’t fret. This isn’t necessarily bad. I mean we’re here with pay aren’t we? And before I get too doom and gloom, just know I’m still more bullish on the technology and a lot of these projects than I’ve ever been. It’s just early and it’s going slower than expected. We see it with bitcoin. We have massive valuations but little to no one using it as digital cash (and only a few as digital gold even). I’ve seen it with Tellor too. We’ve had trouble finding lasting users. There’s no shortage of partnerships announcements that will never launch, copycat rug pulls that use you for a day and you don’t want to tell anyone about, or new chains that you can launch on but will never get any traction either. But yet we continue and so do countless other projects in our position because we believe in the future of the technology and we’re adapting as we go.

So what does this mean now for projects?

If your project’s been here a while, it’s got to change. You likely haven’t solved anything, and our thoughts and best practices are changing. Don’t cling onto the memes of the past that pumped your token a few years ago. Bitcoin’s the shining example of this, where the narrative and entrenched “community” simply don’t want to let go of a failed premise. Sure it can work for a price narrative and a small meme crowd keeping your token active, but it’s dead tech and you’ll get left behind. If you’re an L1 still sticking with PoW, crazy about dPoS, or trying to get adoption with a new programming language for smart contracts, you’re delusional. Don’t give people an excuse to not use your product. The design space left is trade-offs and you should be able articulate what they are and why you made those trade-offs.

On a similar note, if you’re starting a project in the space, don’t expect something crazy. It’s all still feelers and playgrounds out here. And for Christ’s sake, don’t feel like you’re competing. The only thing that you’re really competing on is narrative and trying to get that speculator cash to pump your token. But in terms of real competition…there’s not enough paying users to make any of this work (maybe (and I emphasize maybe) Ethereum has product market fit, but little else besides arbitrage and meme-coin gambling). It also means that actual users are few and far between, so you don’t need a large marketing budget. You and your team could (and very well might) shake hands with every user you actually get. You just have to hustle and be engaged. Integrations are still in the white glove stage for oracles and most projects out there. This means you hold their hands, push to their github, and pay for the service out of your token or vc cash. Everything’s still subsidized by tokens with very few exceptions. But thankfully…

<b>yuuge valuations</b>

Valuations are still ridiculous; and yes, even in the bear market. Sure, it’s amazing to see tons of cryptographic and freedom preserving research being funded; love it. But we shouldn’t delude ourselves that people want it. It’s largely a game of predatory VC’s finding a new toy w/ a 6–12 month turnaround time and then dumping on retail. So take it for what it is. As a project, what you need to know is how to find the narrative of the moment and push it. People are starting to see through the pure meme coins, so you have to get some TVL and usage, but this is all just the same game. If you don’t have users, you either pay for them or build them yourselves (cough, cough, great job Solana). Ideally though, you build them into the mechanism. Uniswap for instance is the most successful version of this. In v2 you have a party who’s indifferent about holding ETH/USDC in a pool (who knows, hypothetically maybe a big VC or someone you might promise a large airdrop too…that would be wild). But with this setup, you get natural volume just as prices move. Arbitrageurs rebalance your pool thousands of times a day, even if you have no actual trade demand. This is instant usage and volume with no work on your end after the pool initialization. And this is no knock on Uniswap. In my mind, the real revolution of uniswap was permissionless listing of tokens, the massive TVL is just a side show that doesn’t tell us much about real demand.

<b>the multichain future</b>

If it hasn’t become clear to you already, we’re heading for a multichain future. This stuff just doesn’t scale otherwise. There’s also so much money out there (see point 2), that no L1 or L2 can possibly kill off the others. Billions of dollars of token capital means that the L1’s made in this cycle are here with us for at least another ten years. In the same way Tezos and EOS from the ’17 boom live on. It’s clear Ethereum is the L1 winner so far, but no one’s just going to roll over and die. They have cash so the big guys are going to make themselves a market and see if it sticks. Even though Ethereum won in one aspect, there’s no clear winner in the app chain race (the format for new chains for each application). The ETH roadmap is rollups validated by the mainchain. This is cool, but making rollups for your own project is still hella hard. I can spin up a chain on cosmos, avalanche, or polkadot way easier than building a rollup and it’s this opening that gives these latter guys a little relevance in the near term and another chance to be in the conversation. The big hurdle for them at the moment however is making app-chains easy, but also relevant/usable within the current Ethereum dominated space.

<b>more tokens, more chains, more problems</b>

In the same way bitcoin, and later crypto as a whole, scaled by multiple chains and tokens, the space is currently just growing by copies. People demand roughly free chains, and they’ll move to or create places to get them (they’re fine paying smaller amounts, but long term they stray). So we’re going to keep making new chains and new tokens, but we’ve hit a world where you no longer need to make an L1, and in fact it’s much harder to do so. If you want to be relevant today, you need to be interoperable and have a base level of security, so an L2 is really the only option. You need to have a bridge, and you need to have the stuff devs/users expect (oracles, AMM’s, lending pools). If a project is on ETH and they want to use some new chain, they need to be able to get their token there, and have the infrastructure there to get it up and running. It makes sense then (and we’re seeing it happen) that new and existing chains are going to place higher priority on connecting to everything. Lots of people see this and that’s why you see tons of bridges popping up (layer zero, nomad, celer, across, chainlink’s lame try, etc. etc.). But these are almost all just multi-sigs underneath. The big reason is that a bridge is just an oracle. It’s an oracle reading a value from another chain. As you probably know already, oracles are tough. They need to be slow (currently) to have security and they need to be even slower if value is larger or if things aren’t finalized quickly (like dealing with other chains).

This is a UX nightmare for bridges. Especially in trading scenarios. People want fast and anything less is unacceptable. I have enough faith in the space to know that we’re not going to let this fly long term with this multi-sig admin key shit, but we’re deluding ourselves if we think that mass adoption will just sacrifice UX for the sake of decentralization (I’m crying inside if you can’t tell). The real answer is just a technical knee bend to the existing chains with volume, namely Ethereum. All new L1’s (and older ones looking to stay relevant) will build bridges to each other and validate with their own validators. The way I envision it is that everything will sort of be these pseudo-side chains of one another, probably with Ethereum as the hub. So you’ll get a subnet on AVAX or a parachain on Polkadot to basically just be a light client to Ethereum and then you bridge things back and forth. Then since you already have a cool hub and spoke model in your system, you pass that bridged asset or message around using whatever method your chain network uses (IBC, XCMP, etc). It’s not perfect because it bloats some state and gives in to another ecosystem, but it’s way better than what we have and it completely removes the trust assumptions of these third party multi-sigs (I mean bridges). Since ETH is also defacto secure, you use it as a hub and now everything connects to one of these hubs and now we have a connected blockchain ecosystem.

So what this spells for oracles is that they’ll probably not be used for bridging generic chain info (sorry bridge builders). Hmmm…so where do oracles go from here…

<b>oracles of the future</b>

To start out, let’s reiterate a common talking point of mine: the scalability trilemma holds for oracles and L1’s alike. If you want it fast, you have to give up security. If you want it decentralized, you have to give up speed. You get to pick two.

If this tech moves in phases, I’d say we’re in the early 2015 bitcoin phase of oracle tech; namely because you still need such long wait times for security (if you’re actually decentralized). This may come off as blasphemy to those projects using centralized oracles, but if you look at the landscape of actual (or at least even theoretically) decentralized oracles, they’re really these optimistic games that under the hood boil down to some voting scenario, Schelling, or staking game. And let’s be clear, there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just how a generic oracle (subjective non-predetermined things) needs to be settled. The obvious downside is that it can be slow to have finality if you want some large amount of value secured. In the future, I’m guessing we’ll just tie more value to the stakes and move away from more generic structures so you don’t have to wait as long. Unfortunately for users now though, the guys with the money aren’t doing it right quite yet and the demand for decentralized oracles doesn’t give nearly enough in terms of rewards to justify large or data feed specific lock ups of size.


Another trend I see the space looping back around too is that I see more projects being their own oracles. I know this is sort of blasphemy from a founder of an oracle project to say, but I see it as both a missed opportunity and a missed security angle for many projects and oracle providers too. Almost all projects out there now have governance tokens, payment tokens, or some coin that in the end you’re just “holding”(whether it gets a fee or not). This is a wasted chance to use it for securing the protocol. This isn’t to say that external oracle services won’t be used, but projects will likely require additional staking requirements in the form of their own token.

One of the beauties/draws of being an oracle is the need or practicality for its own token. This is because if you trash the oracle to break a project, you want the underlying stake to be worthless (this gives it great security properties). So the question for other projects, why not have this principle work for you as well? By having them stake their own token, you get the added benefit of if someone breaks the oracle to profit off your protocol, it’s once again….more costly because they now are holding a worthless token. Staking your own token can also help negate the problem inherent in relying solely on an outside system ….no one wants to say they’re wrong. You’ve seen this with LINK or insurance protocols before, where they fuck up, but there’s no slashing or penalty because its your fault. They don’t want the system to look wrong or weak, so you’re screwed. Granted this problem can exist if you just use your token, but finding the balance here is a key design area I’m excited about. When a token is probably newer or less distributed than the oracle token, it could make sense to just use an external oracle, but if you need more value staked to insure greater value at faster speeds, you can focus on using your own token as collateral (something that might be more readily available than external value).

The last trend for oracles is that they’ll look more like protocols. Tellor is leading the pack in this regard, but most of the space (definitely not limited to oracles) is still pretending to be tech startups with a goal of being a fortune 500 company. Let’s be honest, the whole governance token schtick is coming to an end and relying on non-crypto economic incentives or participation is a risk. You want a protocol that functions with as few people as possible. Token weighted voting, governance, upgrades, community, these should all be seen as negatives when it comes to something holding your money. Yes, we of course need subjectivity in oracles. By definition an oracle is only used when the chain can’t verify something itself. So you need some sort of human or pseudo-human interaction w/ regard to the input and dispute resolution but trying to minimize it is key. Any system that relies too much on participation or necessitates a lot of parties paying attention is set up to fail. The trend is that oracles will give information, but the dispute resolution piece for the actual validity of the data will be left to protocols. Kind of goes back to protocols requiring their own stakes, but generalized oracles are not set up to handle the specific nuances that an individual protocol might want regarding the resolution of a disagreement.

<b>oracles and unique data sources</b>

The related business opportunity developing tangential to oracle infrastructure is specialized or unique data sources. You see it happening already with bridge architecture (all these bridges are just specialized oracles), but it will soon extend to other metrics as well, namely things like inflation, price feeds/settlement prices with standardized definitions and methodologies, employment statistics, gdp, wellness numbers, or anything published traditionally by the government.

These fit the definition of something that should be done in a transparent and decentralized manner. Preventing capture by government or corporate interests has historically been a huge issue for these statistics. They’ve long been understood to be a public good, and with the advent of decentralized technologies, we have actual ways to make public. There are still a lot of questions as to who pays for the survey collections and how to even globally collect these statistics, but this is the next frontier for the oracle space and it’s exciting. Honest statistics, not manipulated by an industry or even sometimes a government entity, are going to be key in creating an alternate, non-USD centric financial system that’s not dependent on the current players, infrastructure, or research.

<b>conclusion</b>

I’m super bullish on the space. We’re so close to wrecking the global financial system and I couldn’t be more excited. The original dream of private money has been looked over as our priorities have swayed with the funding and narrative, but the tech is here. Let’s just keep putting the pieces together and we’re going to make something lasting that we can be proud of.
